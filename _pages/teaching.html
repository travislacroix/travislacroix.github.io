<!---<h2> Teaching Statement </h2>

<p>
   My foremost objectives as an instructor are to (1) foster students' confidence in their capacity to succeed in philosophy while (2) helping to improve their abilities in a variety of transferable skills, including their abilities to read, write, speak, and think clearly, critically, and deeply about philosophical ideas and (3) enabling them to see the applicability of philosophy to their everyday lives. To do so, I use a goal-based approach to course design and delivery that emphasises the importance of motivation for successful learning, derived from contemporary empirical research on effective pedagogy.

               <p><strong>Description</strong>. This course explores formal approaches (evolutionary game theory, network models, and agent-based models) and their applications in understanding and explaining social phenomena. The course will critically examine the philosophical foundations of these formal approaches and their relevance in addressing various questions in social science. Each week will focus on specific game structures and models that illustrate their applications in explaining real-world social phenomena. By the end of the course, students will gain a deep understanding of the conceptual and methodological aspects of formal approaches in the philosophy of social science. </p>

         <div class="indented">
               <p><strong>Description</strong>. According to Stuart Murray (2012), â€˜The very idea of an autistic person is a philosophical oneâ€™. This course is about autism and philosophy. According to Kenneth Richman, the philosophy of autism is not (yet) a subfield of philosophy. Instead, philosophical work on autism falls mostly under ethics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of psychology, or philosophy of medicine. However, as we shall see, the autism spectrum provides a philosophically rich vehicle for considering philosophical perspectives in a much wider array of subfields and topics.</p>

<p>Owing to the nature of the subject, the presentation of this course will not be structured like a â€˜typicalâ€™ philosophy seminar. Because of stigma, misinformation, and confusion surrounding autism, we will begin our seminar (Weeks 2-5) with an historical overview of autism as a diagnosis in the early-mid twentieth century. The first part of the course will be primarily lecture-based, with some in-class activities. To gain a better understanding of autism from within autism, the â€˜readingsâ€™ for these weeks will consists in videos, essays, stories, blog posts, etc. told from an autistic perspective. The rest of the semester (Weeks 6-14) we will continue in a seminar format. Our discussions will span a variety of philosophically rich topics in the philosophy of autism and autistic approaches to philosophy. </p>

            <summary>Autumn&nbsp;2021&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<em>Topics in Ethics I</em> (PHIL 4115, 5115; <strong>Topic</strong>: 'Evolutionary Ethics')</summary>
            <div class="indented">
               <p><strong>Description</strong>. In a 1973 article, evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky proclaimed that â€˜nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolutionâ€™. One way to understand this provocative statement is that biology (in terms of the observed diversity of life and its distribution on the earthâ€™s surface) only makes sense in the light of evolution because it only makes sense if life on earth has a shared history. If we take this sentiment seriously, then in order to (truly) understand (nearly) any facet of human life, we ought to understand it in the context of the evolutionary history of humanity (as a species). Rather than assuming that ethics is the result of divine revelation or the application of our rational faculties, evolutionary ethics examines the possibility that morality is a social phenomenon, borne out of the biological and cultural evolution of intelligent, social creatures.</p>
               <p>In this course, we will examine proto-morality and pro-social behaviour, as it appears in non-human animals (especially primates). We will also examine possible mechanisms of evolution that may apply to the evolution of moral behaviour in humans, including natural selection, sexual selection, kin selection, and group selection, in addition to social adaptations that may aid, foster, or give rise to moral behaviour, including altruism, signalling, cooperation, and conventions. On the philosophical side of things, we will discuss how a biological point of view allows and disallows certain normative concepts; we will also discuss criticisms of such a biological approach and contemporary challenges for evolutionary ethics.</p>
               <p>In a paraphrase of a question posed by the linguist and cognitive scientist Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, this course will essentially centre upon two converse questions:</p>
               <ol>
                  <li>What is <strong>ethics</strong>, that it may have evolved? And,</li>
                  <li>What is evolution, that it may apply to <strong>ethics</strong>?</li>
