## Abstract

In Lewis&apos; (1969) conception of a signalling game, salience is offered as an explanation for how individuals may come to agree upon a linguistic convention. Skyrms (2010) offers a dynamic explanation of how signalling conventions might arise presupposing no salience whatsoever. I extend the atomic signalling game to include a variable parameter which allows for &apos;degrees&apos; of salience, thus filling in the continuum between Skyrms&apos; and Lewis&apos; respective models.
